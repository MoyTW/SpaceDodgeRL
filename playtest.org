+ the map menu gets really hard to read at big resolutions
  - buttons get spaced out
  - hard to tell which "GO" correlated with which button
+ ESCAPE should close the map
+ Eventually the scroll in the event log freezes
+ Destroyer seems to fire, but the shot hangs (are they in the same tick as player?)
+ I could really use an "autoloot sector" button!
+ I think...it broke when I took up to my limit in items? yep, InventoryFullCannotStoreException
  - I could use a readout on inventory size, that seems helpful
+ Well game crashed, I'll patch that and continue
