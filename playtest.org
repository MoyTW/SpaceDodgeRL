+ the map menu gets really hard to read at big resolutions
  - buttons get spaced out
  - hard to tell which "GO" correlated with which button
+ ESCAPE should close the map
+ Eventually the scroll in the event log freezes
+ Destroyer seems to fire, but the shot hangs (are they in the same tick as player?)
+ I could really use an "autoloot sector" button!
+ I think...it broke when I took up to my limit in items? yep, InventoryFullCannotStoreException
  - I could use a readout on inventory size, that seems helpful
+ Well game crashed, I'll patch that and continue
+ fixed, confirmed
+ sometimes cutting beam laser finishes SO FAST you don't even see it
  - basically if you're right up next to a guy
  - this is probably the same with a shot that hits you as you're right next to something
  - fix that Tween timing issue?
+ even the inventory doesn't tell you how many slots you have left, that's definitely bad
+ inventory still has TODO: item descriptions, rip
+ there are white squares for...I think items that you've picked up? that vanish when you enter sight
+ FoW resets when you load
+ projectile paths not drawn when you load
+ newly picked-up items go to the last column in the inventory?
  - if you use an item in the left column then pick an item up it goes to the right?
+ you can't hold down button to scroll your menu buttons...annoying!
+ intel doesn't auto-use which is annoying
+ path danger doesn't take into account collision
+ ending for now ~level 5
